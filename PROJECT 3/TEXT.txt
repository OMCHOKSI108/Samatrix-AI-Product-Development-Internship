House Price Prediction Project Summary
=====================================

Project Overview
---------------
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices using linear regression. The project was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship TASK 1 LEVEL 2.

Dataset Information
-----------------
- Source: Housing dataset containing various features of houses and their prices
- Features: 12 key characteristics including:
  * Numerical features: area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking
  * Categorical features: mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, prefarea, furnishing

Project Implementation
--------------------
1. Data Collection and Exploration
   - Loaded and analyzed the housing dataset
   - Performed comprehensive data visualization
   - Checked for missing values and data quality

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Converted categorical variables to numeric format
   - Analyzed feature correlations
   - Prepared data for model training

3. Model Development
   - Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
   - Created prediction function with error handling

4. Model Evaluation
   - Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
   - Analyzed feature importance
   - Generated prediction intervals and confidence scores

Key Visualizations Created
------------------------

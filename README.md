## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder         | Project Title                                | Brief Description |
|--------------- |----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| ` PROJECT1 `  | **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**          | Performed in-depth EDA on a structured dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and distributions. Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib. |
| ` PROJECT2 `  | **Classification on Business Data**          | Built supervised ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to classify business outcomes. Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC. |
| ` PROJECT3 `  | **Customer Segmentation using Clustering**   | Used K-Means and hierarchical clustering to segment users based on behavior and demographics. Interpreted clusters for business personalization. |
| ` PROJECT4 `  | **Predictive Modeling with Regression**      | Developed regression models to forecast numerical values (e.g., sales, revenue, demand). Applied feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. |
| ` PROJECT5 `  | **A/B Testing for Optimization**             | Conducted hypothesis testing and A/B experiments to assess the impact of design or product changes on user conversion rates. |
| ` PROJECT6 `  | **Dashboarding & KPIs**                      | Created insightful dashboards (with Matplotlib or Power BI) to visualize KPIs and track business metrics effectively. |
| ` PROJECT7 `  | **Domain-Specific Project (e.g., Healthcare / Finance)** | Applied machine learning and data analysis in a specialized context — such as survival analysis in clinical trials or time-series forecasting in finance. |
